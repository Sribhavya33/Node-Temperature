# Node-Temperature
You need to install npm and node to run this code 
It is used to know the present temperature of a place by giving the name at the output 
so you need to download the whole document 
check for node -v and npm - v in CMD before running is it working or else install.
Then give the command node app.js -a Texas( any place you want to know the temperature)
App.js is the main .js file where it captures the geo location of the place you provided and gives the temperature.
